      <h1>Matthew Day - Aspiring Web Developer</h1>
      <p>
        I'm transitioning into web development, with a focus on clean, reliable
        HTML and CSS.
      </p>
      <p>This site is to showcase my projects and learning progress.</p>

      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I started web development because I enjoy building things and wanted to
        apply that problem-solving mindset to the digital space.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've spent the last 24 years working as a carpenter, turning ideas into
        real, functional projects. That experience has shaped how I approach
        learning: methodically, practically, and with attention to detail.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm now working towards transitioning into a full-time role in web
        development, continuing to build a strong foundation in core
        technologies.

        <h3>Carping Journey</h3>
        <p>
          This was a personal project I built between the CSS and Flexbox/Grid
          sections of my course to reinforce what I had learned before moving
          on. The focus was on creating a responsive layout using only CSS.

      <div>
        <h3>Bootstrap Layout Project</h3>
        <p>
          This project was part of my course and involved recreating a provided
          demo with limited guidance. The focus was on implementing and
          adjusting Bootstrap components to match a given design.
