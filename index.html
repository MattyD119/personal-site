        I'm transitioning into web development, with a focus on clean, reliable
        HTML and CSS.

      <div class="about-text-container">
        <p>
          I started web development because I enjoy building things and wanted
          to apply that problem-solving mindset to the digital space.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've spent the last 24 years working as a carpenter, turning ideas
          into real, functional projects. That experience has shaped how I
          approach learning: methodically, practically, and with attention to
          detail.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm now working towards transitioning into a full-time role in web
          development, continuing to build a strong foundation in core
          technologies.

            This was a personal project I built between the CSS and Flexbox/Grid
            sections of my course to reinforce what I had learned before moving
            on. The focus was on creating a responsive layout using only CSS.

            This project was part of my course and involved recreating a
            provided demo with limited guidance. The focus was on implementing
            and adjusting Bootstrap components to match a given design.
