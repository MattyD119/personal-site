Matthew Day - Aspiring Web Developer
I'm transitioning into web development, with a focus on clean, reliable HTML and CSS
This site is to showcase my projects and learning progress

About Me:

I started web development because I enjoy building things and wanted to apply that problem
solving mindset to the digital space.

I've spent the last 24 years working as a carpenter, turning ideas into real, functonal
projects. That experience has shaped how I approach learning: methodically, practically,
and with attention to detail.

I'm now working towards transitioning into a full-time role in web development, continuing
to build a strong foundation in core technologies.

Project:

Carping Journey

This was a personal project I built between the CSS and Flexbox/Grid sections of my course to reinforce what I had learned before moving on.

The focus was on creating a responsive layout using only CSS.

bootstrap layout project

This project was part of my course and involved recreating a provided demo with limited guidance.

The focus was on implementing and adjusting Bootstrap components to match a given design.
